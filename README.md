🎬 Network Engineer Home Lab – Part 2 (Advanced Enterprise Features)
🎯 Goal of Part 2

In this lab, we expand the network to include:

Multiple switches

OSPF dynamic routing

Redundancy concepts

Port security

SSH remote management

Basic network monitoring

Now we’re simulating something closer to a real company network.

🏢 Step 1: Expand the Topology
Add:

1 additional Router

1 additional Switch

2 more PCs

Talking Points:

“Real networks don’t run on one router and one switch.”

“We’re now simulating multiple departments or branch offices.”

“Redundancy and scalability are what separate small networks from enterprise networks.”

🌍 Step 2: Configure OSPF (Dynamic Routing)

Instead of static routes, we use OSPF.

Router 1:
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

Router 2:
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0

Talking Points:

“OSPF allows routers to automatically learn routes.”

“This is scalable. If we add another network, OSPF adapts.”

“Dynamic routing is used in almost every enterprise environment.”

Then show:

show ip route


Highlight the O routes (OSPF learned routes).

🔁 Step 3: Redundancy Concept (Basic Introduction)

Explain:

Why having 2 routers prevents downtime.

What happens if one router fails.

You can simulate:

Shut down one interface:

interface g0/0
shutdown


Then show how routing adjusts.

Talking Points:

“Downtime costs companies money.”

“Redundancy increases reliability.”

“High availability is a key network engineering concept.”

🔐 Step 4: Port Security on the Switch

Protect switch ports from unauthorized devices.

interface fa0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 1
 switchport port-security violation shutdown
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky

Talking Points:

“Port security prevents someone from unplugging a PC and plugging in their own laptop.”

“This is basic physical-layer security.”

“Security isn’t just firewalls — it starts at the switch.”

🔑 Step 5: Configure SSH for Secure Remote Access

Instead of Telnet, use SSH.

hostname R1
ip domain-name lab.local
crypto key generate rsa
username admin secret Cisco123
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local

Talking Points:

“Never use Telnet in production.”

“SSH encrypts login credentials.”

“Remote management is essential in real jobs.”

📊 Step 6: Basic Monitoring Commands

Show how to monitor:

show ip interface brief
show ip route
show running-config
show logging
show processes cpu

Talking Points:

“Monitoring is proactive troubleshooting.”

“Engineers don’t wait for problems — they look for warning signs.”

“These commands are daily-use tools in real environments.”
